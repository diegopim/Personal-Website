                <p id="hobbyParagraph">I have been a member of the University of California Marching Band, known as Cal Band, since 2023. 
                    I play the baritone, which I have played since my junior year of high school. 
                    Cal band has introduced to me so many great people and experiences. 
                    Some of my favorite performances were when I got to perform at a Giants Game at Oracle Park in San Francisco 
                    and when we preformed for the Women's Basketball Tournament in Las Vegas. 
                    Check out our performances on the Cal Band Youtube channel (my favorite is Underwater Show).

                        One of my favorite things to do as a kid was reading books about the planets of the Solar System. 
                        That love for space stayed with me for years, and on my 17th birthday, my childhood dream came true: I got a telescope. 
                        Every night, I would stay up until the Moon was in a good viewing position and stare at (the now clearly visible) craters and maria. 
                        When the moon was not visible, I observed the planets and star clusters, and learned a few constellations. 
                        I could not bring my telescope with me to Berkeley, but I still try to stargaze when viewing conditions are right.

                        This is a picture I took on my telescope of a waning gibbous.
